# This is my project for demonstrating 4-color problem. If we think a map where each region is a node and draw vertices between regions which have borders between them, this process yields a planar graph. My code generates random planar graphs with at least 3 nodes (which is equivalent to maps with at least 3 regions) and shows that this graph can be colored with at most 4 colors where each node which are connected with another node are colored differently.
